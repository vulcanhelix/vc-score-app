Advances in cloud and other computing technologies radically reduce the costs of starting and running new businesses, creating opportunities for outsized returns. We invest in teams we believe in and our experience suggests that finding good founding teams and leaving them in place tends to produce higher returns overall. 

As a corollary, we resist shackling a company to its original business model. Businesses really do evolve over time and changing models in the early years is anything but a sign of weakness. We do not expect that the first business model for a company will be the final or best business model and do not see evolution as a negative. The most powerful minds are the ones that can be changed. 

We believe that substantially all of our investments should be directed to companies with an audacious vision seeking enormous markets. So, we will continue to invest in very talented entrepreneurs who are pursuing ambitious, challenging tasks.

iOS, Android, Web & Backend Development - Our software engineers are industry veterans. They leverage enterprise-class code quality with Agile and Lean methodologies to quickly and efficiently bring products to life. We emphasize scalability and extensibility so your product can grow with your users. 

Growth & Marketing - Our analytics and conversion optimization experts can help you optimize your app's analytics suite, manage AB testing regimes, and manage digital marketing campaigns. 

Fueled Ventures - Fueled clients go on to raise millions in funding and have been acquired in massive exits. That's why we offer select startup clients the opportunity to make their development budgets go much further through an investment from Fueled Ventures, our independent venture fund. But even better than an early infusion of cash is the fact that we vest all of our agency employees into our fund. Our team is your team. 

Fueled Collective - The most valuable asset a startup can leverage is other startups. That's why we created the Fueled Collective, a one-of-a-kind coworking space that is home to more than 40 startups in addition to Fueled's New York staff.

Characteristics of companies that we are interested in: 
Since we are in the Seattle area, we tend to be interested in exciting value-driven and B2B tech companies with great teams, early revenues, and a competitive advantage. We invest if we like a company, they like us, and one of our members will put time/work into the company, if necessary. Otherwise, we don't invest.

Categories we might consider: 
B2B software, IoT and scalable hardware, capital-efficient hard-science. Market-accelerating technologies. Low-regulatory-inhibited health: like healthIT, among others.

We have directly sourced >£150m for portfolio companies directly from individuals typically looking for EIS opportunities.

We make very few investments each year and work hard to create successful outcomes. We tend to make thematic investments into fast growth markets, always seeking the most experienced management teams and the most scalable models. Our opportunities are often driven by regulatory or technological change. We are amongst the few growth EIS investors able to demonstrate a successful 12 year track record.

We typically seek board representation and consider ourselves to be key partners in the enterprise.

We differentiate ourselves from a VC or angel investor group, in that we make fewer investments each year. We try to ensure that our companies are fully funded. We are not driven purely by brokerage fees on funds raised. Our model has no management fee and depends upon achieving exits.

Specialties: Finding investors for scalable fast growth businesses that do not yet qualify for institutional investment, but have potential to become the global businesses of tomorrow.

Due diligence of market opportunities and management teams.

Valuation and structuring of deals.

Sourcing of investment.

In the months preceding the official authorization for the agency's creation, Department of Defense Directive Number 5105.15, the Soviet Union had launched an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1, and the world's second satellite, two months after Sputnik 1, resulted in a spectacular fiery failure. Finally, at the end of January 1958, a stunned United States became the second nation to place an object in orbit when it successfully launched the Explorer 1 satellite.

Out of this traumatic experience of technological surprise in the first moments of the Space Age, U.S. leadership created DARPA, initially with the shorter name Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). In the nearly 60 years since it was established, DARPA has owned the critical mission of keeping the United States out front when it comes to cultivating breakthrough technologies for national security rather than in a position of catching up to strategically important innovations and achievements of others.

With no research and development facilities of its own, DARPA has become known as a laboratory and incubator of innovation by providing thought leadership, community-building frameworks, technology challenges, research management, funding, and other cultural and infrastructural support elements that it takes to usher transformative ideas toward consequential new realities.",darpa.mil,41,https://logo.clearbit.com/darpa.mil

The main objective of the fund is to accelerate to market technologies developed by Partners HealthCare investigators, thereby enhancing healthcare quality, cost and outcomes. Structured as a separate LLC entity, the $35M Fund is evergreen in design and will reinvest all gains from investments back into the Fund to create capital for additional investments.

Investment decision oversight is provided by an independent external committee composed of experts from industry, venture capital and academia.

The Fund operates on a venture capital model whereby opportunities are rigorously evaluated on the basis of scientific strength as well as potential for commercial success.

The Fund has four major goals:

* Capture more value from the PHS research portfolio by creating companies, technologies and solutions that advance and enhance healthcare.
* Provide funding for technologies positioned in the capital gap between invention and clinical development.
* By demonstrating institutional commitment, attract external capital that will leverage and encourage co-investment.
* Generate a return on investment to refresh the fund and provide capital for additional technologies.

Gap Funding
Over the last five to seven years, the environment for early-stage investing has undergone significant change. As a result of these changes, there is a dearth of funding support for technologies/companies positioned between invention and clinical development. By focusing on this capital gap, the Fund can advance technologies of high commercial potential and medical benefit to a stage where larger, more traditional investment sources are attracted to underwrite the risk.

Types of Fund Investments
The Partners Innovation Fund will make two types of investments: Equity and Development.

Equity investments are seed and early financings that will catalyze company formation. These investments will often be a Series A stock and co-investors are frequently other early institutional investors, private investors or corporate investment funds.

Development investments precede company formation and are intended to validate technologies with a high potential for later commercialization by either new venture formation or out-licensing to an existing market player.

For all investments, funds will be reserved for participation in follow-on investments.

Innovation Fund Process

Utilizing a proven venture capital based diligence model, the team conducts in-depth diligence on all opportunities in two steps:

1. Initial Screening: Assesses opportunities for high commercial potential. Key project attributes are:

* Product concept and value proposition
* Intellectual Property Position
* Stage of technology development
* Market Opportunity
* Technology Review
* Management Team
* Regulatory pathway
* Funding requirements
* Competitive Analysis
* Business Model 

2. Evaluation and Investment Decision: During this step, PIF staff conducts extensive diligence to assess the strength of the proposed business in relation to our investment criteria. This process takes place over 3 to 6 months during which time we interact with technical and market experts, possible customers, competitors and potential co-investors as we prepare for presentation of the investment opportunity to our external Investment Committee for final approval.

The team will work with investigators and their advisors to develop a project or business plan including connections to potential entrepreneurs, advisors and investors in the venture, private or corporate arena.

Venture Launch / Ongoing Support: Once an investment has been approved, the Innovation Fund plays an active role in the ongoing development of the new venture. The team will work on all aspects required to move the new entity forward including recruiting senior management and staff, providing guidance and support in technology development, serving on the Board of Directors and working with management to achieve milestones.",partnersinnovationfund.com,1,https://logo.clearbit.com/partnersinnovationfund.com

This approach to B2B software investing stems from their deep operational expertise in scaling these types of companies and our conviction that a unique market opportunity exists for innovation within the enterprise. They believe that regardless of background or location, when determined, intelligent people make it their mission to solve a challenging problem and change the world, they often do. They are generalist investors within B2B and target investments in vertical SaaS, software-enabled marketplaces, and knowledge worker tools. Consumer-facing technology, hardware or service-based businesses, and industries like biotech and Web3 that require deep domain expertise to develop conviction fall outside their thesis. LOVC's investments typically demonstrate early product-market fit signals. $15-75K MRR is their sweet spot for recurring revenue businesses, but they understand that product market fit also manifests in other ways. LOVC invests in companies based in the Eastern United States.",lasolasvc.com,Growing,https://logo.clearbit.com/lasolasvc.com
